/home/ubuntu/miniconda3/envs/ELRE/lib/python3.11/site-packages/lightning/pytorch/trainer/connectors/logger_connector/logger_connector.py:67: Starting from v1.9.0, `tensorboardX` has been removed as a dependency of the `lightning.pytorch` package, due to potential conflicts with other packages in the ML ecosystem. For this reason, `logger=True` will use `CSVLogger` as the default logger, unless the `tensorboard` or `tensorboardX` packages are found. Please `pip install lightning[extra]` or one of them to enable TensorBoard support by default
You are using a CUDA device ('NVIDIA A10') that has Tensor Cores. To properly utilize them, you should set `torch.set_float32_matmul_precision('medium' | 'high')` which will trade-off precision for performance. For more details, read https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.set_float32_matmul_precision.html#torch.set_float32_matmul_precision

/home/ubuntu/miniconda3/envs/ELRE/lib/python3.11/site-packages/lightning/pytorch/trainer/connectors/data_connector.py:441: The 'val_dataloader' does not have many workers which may be a bottleneck. Consider increasing the value of the `num_workers` argument` to `num_workers=29` in the `DataLoader` to improve performance.
/home/ubuntu/miniconda3/envs/ELRE/lib/python3.11/site-packages/lightning/pytorch/trainer/connectors/data_connector.py:385: You have overridden `transfer_batch_to_device` in `LightningModule` but have passed in a `LightningDataModule`. It will use the implementation from `LightningModule` instance.
